Friends, the Creator of the universe has graciously revealed Himself to us in His Word and through His Son Jesus Christ. His revelation is a precious treasure that we must cherish and defend. God’s Word is truth (Jn. 17.17) and it is the truth we need. Scripture alone reveals God’s loving-kindness toward sinners in Christ. The Bible is sufficient to equip Christ’s sheep for every good work and believers need nothing else to know how they might please and serve Christ in this world (2 Tim. 2.16-17).

If you are in Christ, rejoice that the Father has sent His Spirit to you to open your eyes to the Truth and bring you to new life (Jn. 3.3). Those dead in bondage to their sin cannot understand His Word (1 Cor. 1 & 2) apart from the Holy Spirit bringing them to saving faith. And while it is true that we will never know the whole mind of God as finite creatures, what God has clearly revealed through His Word we can know and act upon with complete confidence (Deut. 29.29). Knowledge and wisdom begin with the fear of the Lord (cf. Prov. 1) and whatever demonic forces throw our way, remember that there is nothing new under the sun (Ecc. 1.9).

God’s Word, and God’s Word alone, is all that we need to please the Creator and live skillfully in the fear of the Lord (Ecc. 12.13). The law of the LORD is perfect, pure, true, and righteous altogether (Ps. 19.7-9). Trust it. Believe it. Obey it. You need no other frameworks or philosophies to please God or to serve Him as effective ambassadors until Christ returns as King. Those who reject the Word of the LORD have no wisdom (Jer. 8.9). The Bible alone is our sure foundation and fountain of truth. 

Why should you lean on broken reeds when God has given us His eternal and unchanging revelation? His Word was sufficient in the past for Christ, the apostles, and the prophets, it is sufficient today for you and me, and it will remain sufficient for all eternity. Wake up! False teachers will arise from within and without (Acts 20.30) – so be alert and contend earnestly for the faith (Jude 3) solidly planted by the stream of His good Word (Ps. 1). Happy is the man who hears and obeys God’s Word – his life will stand every storm of life like a house built upon a solid rock (Matt. 7.24-25).
