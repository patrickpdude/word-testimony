### Chapter 10: Gutless Gracers and Crisis Upgraders
- What is the doctrinal characteristic of Gutless Gracers? (p. 197)

  - It distinguishes Christians from non-Christians.

- What does Christian growth look like and what does it require? (p. 212)

### Chapter 11: The Quagmire of Muzz Mysticism
> "You are trying to live the Christian life. Let go... and let God." - A muzzy mystic 

- What is Andrew Murray's practical focus for the Christian life? (p. 214-215)

- Against waht do all ideas need to be tested? (p. 217)

- What was Paul's view of "being in the flesh?" (p. 238)
  - It is a past reality for every Christian (Romans 7:5; 8:4). There are only two kinds of people - those in the flesh and those in the Spirit. They are mutually exclusive. If you are "in the flesh" you are not in Christ.

- How does Paul view justification, sanctification, struggle, and life in the Spirit in the Christian's life? (p. 240-241)
  - They are **simultaneous facets** of the Christian's life, not stages.

- Who produces in us a life that pleases God? (p. 245) 
  - The Spirit - not human effort 

- Why should we not lose heart in our struggle against our flesh? (p.246-247) 
  - The struggle means that the Holy Spirit is within us. You are alive! 

- What is our response to our flesh (denial, defeat, deal)?  (p. 248-249)

  - Christ's death, burial, resurrection, and ascension (John 7:39)

  - The blood Christ shed on the cross. His death was **necessary**.

- What is the meaning of the words "Christ" and "Messiah"? (p. 263)
  - "Anointed one" - specifically anointed with the Holy Spirit

- What should our personal response to Christ's gift of the indwelling Holy Spirit be? (p. 268-275)
  - Thank, trust, target, and toil

### Culmination - Putting It All Together
- If the absolute centrality of God is true, what is life about? (p. 280)
  - Finding out how to please and relate to God - God is ultimate!

- What is the ultimate cause of all the world's miseries? (p. 282-283)
  - Sin - as God defines it. (The cure is the Gospel.)

- What is the center of Christian life, thought, worship, and message? (p. 295)
  - Jesus Christ

### Afterword - "Say... What Did You Just Do?"
- What is the issue with **only** affirming 1 Corinthians 15 as the elements of the Gospel? (p. 305)
  - The world has its own definitions! The truths must be believed "in accordance with the Scriptures."

- What is the need the Gospel answers? (p. 308)
  - We need a relationship with God that is **real**, **dynamic**, and **going somewhere**. God **planned** to rescue **through His power** all who believe in Christ through the Gospel to the purpose of **glorifying God** now and forever.
