## Psalm 2: Framing the Book of Hebrews

### Context 
> Hebrews 1:2, 5 NKJV  
2 has in these last days spoken to us by [His] Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; ...  
5 For to which of the angels did He ever say: "You are My Son, Today I have begotten You"? And again: "I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be to Me a Son"?

> Hebrews 12:22, 25, 28-29 NKJV  
22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, ...  
25 See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more [shall we not escape] if we turn away from Him who [speaks] from heaven, ...  
28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.  
29 For our God [is] a consuming fire.

> Psalm 2:6-7, 10-12 NKJV  
6 "Yet I have set My King  
On My holy hill of Zion."  
7 "I will declare the decree: The LORD has said to Me,  
'You [are] My Son, Today I have begotten You.  
...  
10 Now therefore, be wise, O kings;  
Be instructed, you judges of the earth.  
11 Serve the LORD with fear,  
And rejoice with trembling.  
12 Kiss the Son, lest He be angry,  
And you perish [in] the way,  
When His wrath is kindled but a little.  
Blessed [are] all those who put their trust in Him.


### Mt. Zion Bookends

The author of Hebrews surrounds his argument to the faithful Jews with specific references to Mt. Zion (and its King).

Let's start at the end of Hebrews:  
- Hebrews 12:25 - Don't refuse **God** who **speaks** (through His Son), since  
-- Hebrews 12:22 - You have come to **Mt. Zion** (and consequently seen the King).  
-- -- *Main argument: Jesus is the promised Messiah.*  
-- Hebrews 1:5 - The Son (i.e. the King) is revealed on **Mt. Zion**.  
- Hebrews 1:2 - **God has spoken** through His Son.

Wait. How does Hebrews 1:5 refer to Mt. Zion? Well, Hebrews 1:5 quotes Psalm 2:7 - and the original listeners (who didn't think in terms of "verses") would have immediately thought of the context in Psalm 2. Psalm 2:6 proclaims that the Lord has set His King on Zion and verse six declares that this King is His Son. As soon as the author of Hebrews quotes that snippet of Psalm 2 the hearers (faithful Old Testament Jews) would think of Mt. Zion as the context of that quotation.

The author frames the entire book of Hebrews within the context of Psalm 2 - **listen to the Lord's Annointed *or else*!**

### Consuming Fire

The similarities between Psalm 2 and Hebrews don't end there. Hebrews 12:25, 28-29 correspond idea for idea with Psalm 2:10-12:

| Hebrews 12 | Psalm 2 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. (25) | Now therefore, be wise, O kings; Be instructed, you judges of the earth. (10) |
| For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more [shall we not escape] if we turn away from Him who [speaks] from heaven, (25) | Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, And you perish [in] the way, (12) |
| since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, (28) | Blessed [are] all those who put their trust in Him. (12) |
| ...let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. (28) | Serve the LORD with fear, And rejoice with trembling. (11) |
| For our God [is] a consuming fire. (29) | When His wrath is kindled but a little. (12) |

Listen and submit to the Son - the King!  
Don't refuse Him Who speaks!  
Serve and worship the Lord with fear.  
God's wrath is real and terrible.  

Psalm 2 ends with this promise: "Blessed [are] all those who put their trust in Him."

The faithful Hebrew listeners, knowing well the second Psalm, would realize that the author was calling them to place their trust in the Son, the King, the final Prophet, the Great High Priest. Their hope for that which was promised, the better country of heavenly origin, the things to come, the better and lasting possession, the good things to come, the approaching day, the inherited promises, the age to come, His rest to be entered, the world to come, Mt. Zion itself, would only be realized though listening and submitting to the LORD's Annointed, His Son, Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant.

*Jesus* is the promised Messiah - **LISTEN TO HIM!**
